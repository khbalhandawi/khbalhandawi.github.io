<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/undergrad/labs/mechlab" target="_blank">MECH 362</a> course at McGill. Teaching assistant for the mechanical lab course for 3 semesters – prepared lab manuals, conducted labs, graded student reports, and provided feedback. I incorporated some programming exercises into the syllabus of the mechanical lab course I was teaching so that the students could control their experiments using MATLAB. I also made modifications to the mechanical lab manuals and tutorials to solidify the students’ understanding of fundamental concepts in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics.
