<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/mech-559" target="_blank">MECH 559</a> course at McGill. I came up with a project for students to understand multidisciplinary optimization. Prepared a detailed tutorial document and programming example to help the students implement the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00158-017-1726-0" target="_blank"> nonhierarchical formulation of analytical target cascading</a> for a practical engineering problem. I then asked the students to answer some critical reasoning questions to help them understand why this formulation outperforms other conventional formulations.
