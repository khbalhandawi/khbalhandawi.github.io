I was the sole instructor of the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/mech-559" target="_blank">MECH 559</a> course at McGill. I taught graduate and senior year undergraduate students the principles of numerical optimization with an emphasis on engineering design. The topics covered included First Order Necessary Conditions (FONCs), linear and nonlinear programming, Multi-disciplinary design optimization (MDO), and Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO). I created new lecture material and supporting <a href="https://github.com/khbalhandawi/MECH559_notebooks" target="_blank">Python notebooks</a> to ease the students into programming and implementation of the optimization algorithms taught in class.
