abstract = {A strain based corrosion sensor for the detection of environmental corrosion of pre-stressed structures was developed and tested on mild steel specimens readily available. Theoretically, a beam shaped specimen under a displacement load exhibits a linear relationship between the strain observed at any point through the thickness of the beam cross-section. This property was exploited to detect thickness changes in pre-stressed mild steel specimens in a double bending configuration under an electrochemically excited corrosion reaction. The reaction was accelerated by supplying a DC current to the cell where the specimens act as anodes of the system, while graphite rods serve as cathodes. The strain was logged using fiber optic Bragg grating technology and conventional electrical strain gages simultaneously. Results show a strong relationship between the corrosion rate observed by back-calculation from supplied current and the time derivative of the measured strain values. Application of this sensor can therefore be extended to a variety of structures under mechanical loading, proving valuable for both its ability to measure corrosion rate in real-time, while maintaining an intrinsically safe nature appropriate by industrial standards.},

abstract = {In the oil and gas industry, pipeline integrity is a serious concern due to the consequences of pipeline failure. External corrosion was identified as one of the main causes of pipeline failures worldwide. A solution that addresses the issue of detecting and quantifying corrosivity of environment for application to existing exposed pipelines has been developed. The proposed sensor consists of an electric circuit and a sensing array connected to the circuit. The sensing array is an assembly of strips made of a metal identical to that of the pipe, having the same length and width, but different thicknesses. The sensing array is exposed to the same environment as the pipe. As corrosion propagates in the metal strips of the array, it corrodes the metal until it finally breaks the metal strip apart resulting in a discontinuity in the circuit. The sensor circuit is energized using electromagnetic field, and its function is to indicate which strips in the array are fully corroded. Visual indication is provided to the operator via LEDs. The proposed sensor can be installed on existing pipelines without altering the pipe structure or disturbing the production process. It is passive and has low maintenance requirements. Circuit design was validated through lab experiments. Results obtained from experiments were consistent with simulation results. {\textcopyright} (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

abstract = {Pipeline Inspection Gauges (PIGs) are used for internal corrosion inspection of oil pipelines every 3-5 years. However, between inspection intervals, rapid corrosion may occur, potentially resulting in major accidents. The motivation behind this research project was to develop a safe distributed corrosion sensor placed inside oil pipelines continuously monitoring corrosion. The intrinsically safe nature of light provided motivation for researching fiber optic sensors as a solution. The sensing fiber's cladding features polymer plastic that is chemically sensitive to hydrocarbons within crude oil mixtures. A layer of metal, used in the oil pipeline's construction, is deposited on the polymer cladding, which upon corrosion, exposes the cladding to surrounding hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon's interaction with the cladding locally increases the cladding's refractive index in the radial direction. Light intensity of a traveling pulse is reduced due to local reduction in the modal capacity which is interrogated by Optical Time Domain Reflectometery. Backscattered light is captured in real-Time while using time delay to resolve location, allowing real-Time spatial monitoring of environmental internal corrosion within pipelines spanning large distances. Step index theoretical solutions were used to calculate the power loss due changes in the intensity profile. The power loss is translated into an attenuation coefficient characterizing the expected OTDR trace which was verified against similar experimental results from the literature. A laboratory scale experiment is being developed to assess the validity of the model and the practicality of the solution. {\&}copy; COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract = {Pipelines are the main transportation means for oil and gas products across large distances. Due to the severe conditions they operate in, they are regularly inspected using conventional Pipeline Inspection Gages (PIGs) for corrosion damage. The motivation for researching a real-time distributed monitoring solution arose to mitigate costs and provide a proactive indication of potential failures. Fiber optic sensors with polymer claddings provide a means of detecting contact with hydrocarbons. By coating the fibers with a layer of metal similar in composition to that of the parent pipeline, corrosion of this coating may be detected when the polymer cladding underneath is exposed to the surrounding hydrocarbons contained within the pipeline. A Refractive Index (RI) change occurs in the polymer cladding causing a loss in intensity of a traveling light pulse due to a reduction in the fiber's modal capacity. Intensity losses may be detected using Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) while pinpointing the spatial location of the contact via time delay calculations of the back-scattered pulses. This work presents a theoretical model for the above sensing solution to provide a design tool for the fiber optic cable in the context of hydrocarbon sensing following corrosion of an external metal coating. Results are verified against the experimental data published in the literature.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for integrating failure and lifecycle analysis related to additive manufacturing in a computational multidisciplinary engineering design framework. The specific goal of this framework is to quantify the impact of component design decisions on system-level performance in order to assess alternative manufacturing, re-manufacturing and repair strategies from both technical and business perspectives. The ultimate objective of this research is to enable such considerations in the early product design phases, where sufficient degree of freedom exists to identify component design solutions that can facilitate and accommodate different manufacturing and repair techniques that impact the entire lifecycle. The developed methodology is demonstrated by means of a jet engine component where repair strategies are included as variables in the computational design process. Numerical results confirm that these strategies can be used to trade among design attributes such as lifecycle cost, weight, and performance.},

Existing design approaches do not account for alternative production technologies such as the use of additive manufacturing in life extension processes. This paper presents a modeling and optimization methodology for examining the impact of design decisions in the early development stage on component lifecycle cost during the in-service phase while considering the potential use of additive manufacturing in life extension strategies. Specifically, a system dynamics model is developed to assess different end-of-life scenarios. Finally, an optimization problem is formulated and solved to minimize lifecycle cost with respect to design variables related to remanufacturing.},

abstract = {Design requirements are often uncertain in the early stages of product development. Set-based design (SBD) is a paradigm for exploring, and keeping under consideration, several alternatives so that commitment to a single design can be delayed until requirements are settled. In addition, requirements may change over the lifetime of a component or a system. Novel manufacturing technologies may enable designs to be remanufactured to meet changed requirements. By considering this capability during the (SBD) optimization process, solutions can be scaled to meet evolving requirements and customer specifications even after commitment. Such an ability can also support a circular economy paradigm based on the return of used or discarded components and systems to working condition. We propose a (SBD) methodology to obtain scalable optimal solutions that can satisfy changing requirements through remanufacturing. We first use design optimization and surrogate modeling to obtain parametric optimal designs. This set of parametric optimal designs is then reduced to scalable optimal designs by observing a set of transition rules for the manufacturing process used (additive or subtractive). The methodology is demonstrated by means of a structural aeroengine component that is remanufactured by direct energy deposition of a stiffener to meet higher loading requirements.},

abstract = {Coping with changing requirements by means of introducing design margins may result in overdesign. In this paper, we present a design optimization method for minimizing overdesign by exploiting additive remanufacturing. Our problem formulation makes use of recently defined constituents of design margins: buffer and excess. The proposed method can be used to obtain a set of design decisions for different changing requirement scenarios. We demonstrate it using a turbine rear structure design problem where changes in the temperature loads are met by depositing different types of stiffeners on the outer casing. The results of the case study are visualized in a tradespace, which allows for comparison between sets of optimal, flexible, and robust designs. Results show that the optimized set of design decisions balances flexibility and robustness in a cost-effective manner.},
