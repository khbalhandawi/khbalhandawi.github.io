title: Our paper on scalable designs has been selected for the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design Editor's choice award!
inline: False

The editor's choice award was presented during the ASME [IDETC 2022](https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE) conference held n St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The [paper](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-abstract/143/2/021702/1085767/Scalable-Set-Based-Design-Optimization-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext) was also presented during the JMD [spotlight session](https://asmejmd.org/2022/07/24/invitation-to-idetc-cie-2022-spotlights/) of the conference, where a talk was given about the cost-saving opportunities that remanufacturing can provide. These cost-savings will manifest when changes to the design are needed at some point throughout its lifecycle.

An online [web-app](https://scale-am.herokuapp.com/) was also demonstrated during the session to show how scalability (the ease with which a design can be remanufactured) can be calculated for a given engineering design case.
