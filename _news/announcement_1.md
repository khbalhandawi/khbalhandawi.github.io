Our paper titled ["Design space exploration and evaluation using margin-based trade-offs"](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4063966) is accepted for publication in the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design.

The paper analyzes the value of design margins for multiple design configurations. The most promising candidates in terms of value should provide a good balance between the ability to absorb change in requirements (e.g., a change in structural loads) and the level of overdesign brought about by the margin (e.g., additional weight and cost).
