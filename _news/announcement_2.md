Our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9532002) on infectious disease prevention and control using artificial life models is accepted for publication at the IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence. This is my first attempt at applying my mathematics and optimization expertise in the public health domain.

The paper uses a stochastic agent-based model to simulate human society and the dynamics of infectious disease spread in the population. Stochastic optimization algorithms are used to solve a policy-making problem such that infections and the socio-economic impact of those policies are minimal.

The most effective intervention policies favor frequent testing of essential workers as opposed to prolonged lowdowns that can devastate the economy.
