I successfully defended by doctoral thesis at McGill University's [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/), where I address the design requirements that may change during a product or system’s lifetime​. A special thanks to [GKN Aerospace](https://www.gknaerospace.com/en/about-gkn-aerospace/locations/gkn-aerospace-in-europe/gkn-aerospace-in-sweden/) in Trollhättan, Sweden and the division of [Systems Engineering Design](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ims/research/product-development/Pages/systems-engineering-design.aspx)​, at the Department of Industrial and Materials Science at Chalmers University. The abstract of my dissertation can be found below.

#### Abstract
<div style="text-align: left">The thesis presents novel design methodologies for obtaining sets of design solutions that can address design requirements that may change during a product or system’s lifetime. These methodologies aim at supporting design engineers quantitatively so they can make informed decisions in the early phases of product development when uncertainty is high.
The presented methodologies consider design problems commonly encountered in industry. The applications used in this thesis demonstrate the efficacy of these methodologies and are centered around product remanufacturing by means of directed energy deposition, an additive manufacturing technique. Specifically, they aim at providing design solutions in the form of geometry of the deposit and the remanufacturing process parameters. 
The first methodology considers remanufacturing as a strategy to address changing requirements in design problems. A method to identify sets of design solutions that have the greatest potential for being successfully remanufactured were identified by means of design optimization subject to additive manufacturing process constraints. Since product development involves several design iterations and stages, a second methodology for making decisions based on information from past iterations is introduced in the thesis. It focuses on additive manufacturing problems where design requirements remain constant throughout a time interval referred to as an epoch and only change at discrete times in between epochs. A combinatorial optimization problem is formulated to minimize the level of overdesign throughout multiple epochs while subject to reliability constraints. Sets of optimal design solutions are obtained via combinatorial optimization and are compared against sets of robust and flexible designs in a tradespace.
The remanufacturing of a turbine rear structure, an aeroengine structural component is used to test the proposed methodologies. A stiffener is deposited on the outer casing of the turbine rear structure to increase its stiffness when subjected to thermal loads due to the exhaust gases.</div>
