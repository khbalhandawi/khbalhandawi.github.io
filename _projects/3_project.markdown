*How do you design a component when the design requirements can change at any moment and without advance notice?*

That is the question my dissertation tries to answer. To do so, I came up with design metrics for qualitative descriptions such as flexibility and robustness. I used optimization, automation and machine learning to obtain thousands of possible designs. This is a **1000 fold** increase in the number of alternatives that are presented during client meetings in the industry.

I also developed an [online tool](https://scale-am.herokuapp.com/) to help support decision making and identify *scalable* designs (a form of flexibility when remanufacturing is an option). The tools relies on machine learning models (as surrogates for physics-based models) to estimate the sensitivity of the design to external changes (loads, specs, etc.) and whether it can be scaled to fulfil said changes.

<script>
    var index = 0;

    function changeBanner() {

        loop_imgs = document.getElementById("animation").children;
        
        [].forEach.call(loop_imgs, function(v, i) {
            loop_imgs[i].hidden = i !== index
        });
        index = (index + 1) % loop_imgs.length;
    }
    window.onload = function() {
        setInterval(changeBanner, 1000)
    };
</script>

By exploring all these alternatives, potential cost savings can be made over a period of decades. My research culminated in a technology transfer at [GKN Aerospace Engine Systems](https://www.gknaerospace.com/en/about-gkn-aerospace/locations/gkn-aerospace-in-europe/gkn-aerospace-in-sweden/) so that engineers can go to work, incorporating these algorithms in their workflows and give GKN a **competitive edge**.

The research also resulted in a best paper award in the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design for 2021. The award was presented at the IDECT-2022 conference in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.
