I took a liking to design and manufacturing ever since I started learning about engineering. Naturally, I gravitated towards roles in the Khalifa University solar car team that would align with my interests. I took charge of the aerodynamic design of the body and driver canopy. 

After the vehicle was built, I oversaw the manufacturing of the various components and accessories needed to operate the vehicle. One such example is shown below for a portable and compact stand on which to place the vehicle solar array during charging. It could also be titled in order to track the sun at different times of the day.

My team competed in The Abu Dhabi Solar Challenge (January 15th â€“ 19th 2015) earning **second place**. We were the first from our country (the UAE) to compete in such an event.
