*How do you design a component when the design requirements can change at any moment and without advance notice?*

That is the question my dissertation tries to answer. To do so, I came up with design metrics for qualitative descriptions such as flexibility and robustness. I used optimization, automation and machine learning to obtain thousands of possible designs. This is a **1000 fold** increase in the number of alternatives that are presented during client meetings in the industry.

By exploring all these alternatives, potential cost savings can be made over a period of decades. My research culminated in a technology transfer at [GKN Aerospace Engine Systems](https://www.gknaerospace.com/en/about-gkn-aerospace/locations/gkn-aerospace-in-europe/gkn-aerospace-in-sweden/) so that engineers can go to work, incorporating these algorithms in their workflows and give GKN a **competitive edge**.
