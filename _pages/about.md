I am a researcher working on solving engineering and mathematics problems using numerical methods. The underlying theme of my research is numerical optimization. I believe that optimization can be used to solve a wide range of decision making problems encountered in design, manufacturing, and operations. 

I love teaching and helping others solve everyday decision-making problems using optimization. I also teach optimization principles to engineering students so that they can apply them in their designs, research, and work.

In my research, I have used optimization to solve practical engineering problems, where the functions of interest are given by expensive numerical simulation. I also used the same principles to solve similar problems in other fields such as epidemiology, statistical modeling, and transportation.
