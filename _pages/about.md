I am a researcher working on solving engineering and mathematics problems commonly encountered in the engineering world. The underlying theme of my research is numerical optimization. I believe that numerical optimization can be used to solve a wide range of decision making problems encountered in design, manufacturing, and operations. 

I have recently branched out to augment machine learning algorithms with recent advances in numerical optimization, particularly derivative-free blackbox optimization algorithms. Such algorithms can substitute heuristic optimization algorithms to accelerate the learning process by reducing the computational overhead. 

I have solved several problems pertaining to additive manufacturing, product remanufacturing, epidemiology, and machine learning sequence completion models.
